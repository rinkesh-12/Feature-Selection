🔑 Must-Know Topics for Feature Selection & Model Performance
1. Basic Feature Selection Methods

Removing constant / quasi-constant features (no variance → useless).

Correlation-based removal (multicollinearity → drop highly correlated features).

Chi-Square Test (for categorical features & classification tasks).

ANOVA (f-test) (numerical vs categorical target).

Information Gain / Mutual Information (for both regression & classification).

👉 These improve speed and reduce overfitting by removing noise.

2. Advanced Feature Selection Techniques

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) – backward elimination with ML models.

Embedded Methods:

Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization) – shrinks coefficients, some go to zero.

Ridge (L2) – reduces variance but keeps all features.

ElasticNet – combination of L1 + L2.

Tree-based Feature Importance (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & SVD – dimensionality reduction for speed, but features lose interpretability.

Autoencoder-based Feature Extraction (in Deep Learning).

👉 Used to get fewer but stronger predictors.

3. Dealing with Overfitting

Cross-validation (K-Fold CV).

Regularization (L1, L2).

Early stopping (especially in boosting).

Dropout (in neural nets).

Pruning in trees.

Feature selection (less noisy features → better generalization).

👉 Interviewers love questions like: “How do you prevent overfitting in ML models?”

4. Feature Engineering (Common Across Projects)

Handling missing values (imputation techniques).

Handling categorical variables:

One-hot encoding

Label encoding

Target encoding

Scaling numerical features (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler).

Creating interaction terms (feature crosses).

Domain-specific feature extraction.

5. Evaluation of Features

Feature Importance plots (from tree models).

Permutation Importance (shuffling feature values to see impact).

SHAP / LIME (explainability, very popular in interviews).

6. Key Theoretical Knowledge for Interviews

Curse of Dimensionality (why feature selection is important).

Bias-Variance Tradeoff.

Why high correlation is bad for models like regression.

Difference between filter, wrapper, and embedded methods.

When to use PCA vs feature selection.

Why regularization helps prevent overfitting.

✅ Pro Tip for Interviews:
If they ask “How do you select features in your projects?” → Answer step by step:

Remove constant/quasi-constant features.

Remove highly correlated features.

Use univariate statistical tests (chi-square, ANOVA, MI).

Use embedded models (Lasso, RF, XGBoost) for final selection.

Validate with cross-validation.
